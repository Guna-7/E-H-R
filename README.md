Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Record (EHR) System
A secure, decentralized Electronic Health Record system built with Java that leverages blockchain technology to ensure data integrity, security, and immutability of patient health records. The system features advanced encryption, hashing mechanisms, and a distributed ledger for storing medical records.
üè• Overview
This blockchain-powered EHR system provides a revolutionary approach to healthcare data management. By combining traditional database storage with blockchain technology, the system ensures that health records are tamper-proof, traceable, and securely shared between healthcare providers and patients. Each medical record is encrypted, hashed, and stored as a block in the blockchain, providing unprecedented security and data integrity.
üîó Key Features
Blockchain Technology

Immutable Records: Health records stored in blockchain blocks cannot be altered or deleted
Distributed Ledger: Decentralized storage ensuring data availability and redundancy
